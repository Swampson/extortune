### **Date**: 24th of the Fading - 1st of Leaffall, 1496 DR  \ (June 20, 2020, C.E.)


### **Personnel**: Julian, Calbraith, Randirok, Tynnifer, Toox


## Minutes

*   **Thrumm** is recalled to head office; but his replacement, **Toox**, an ominous-looking Aasimar, arrives quickly in Phandalin to pick up the slack
*   **Jasper** notices that the [arcane orrery](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/943533-arcane-orrery) has a new switch - allowing it to (probably magically) fold into an attache case sized, easily carried parcel
*   A lengthy negotiation over carriage rentals, including collision and liability insurance premiums, ensues. Eventually, a carriage is requisitioned from Head Office at a bargain price instead
*   **Toox** still tries to pay the carriage rental guy some money for some reason
*   The first official month in business is a resounding success, and the franchise turns a welcome profit (which is immediately spent on the above-mentioned new carriage)
*   Departing for the North, the franchise leaves instructions with their staff to complete the reconstruction of the headquarters. **Toox** also leaves an encouraging note. But no tiny red books - yet.
*   On the fourth day of the journey north the party encounters a **druid** herding two flail snails. **Calbraith** is wounded by one and the party decides to let them pass, although they are not convinced the so-called druid is on the level
*   As soon as they arrive within sight of Silent Sound, they find a small party of sailors a few feet off the coast beset by 25 tentacles (3 octopi and two sea spawn - one of which has a tentacle in place of an arm). The franchisees act quickly but are only able to rescue one of the three sailors - a human woman named **Belle Mare**, from the clutches of the pelagic assault
